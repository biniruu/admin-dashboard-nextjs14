# Admin Dashboard with Next.js 14 and TypeScript

This is for learning Next.js 14 with a server action and more.

## Development Environment

- Next.js 14
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS (+ PostCSS)
- NextAuth.js
- MongoDB
- Mongoose

## Todo

- [x] Build dev env
- [x] Build Dashboard
- [x] Build Users page
- [x] Build Products page
- [ ] Authentication

## Notice

At this moment, I am going to build just two menus: Users and Products.

I did not originally plan this project; It was created by someone else. I have reproduced it in TypeScript and making extensive refactoring and reorganising the directory structure.
