# Admin Dashboard with Next.js 14 and TypeScript

This is for learning Next.js 14 with a server action and more.

## Development Environment

I used a starter pack to build this dev env:
[https://github.com/biniruu/starter-pack/tree/main/next-typescript](https://github.com/biniruu/starter-pack/tree/main/next-typescript)

## Most Important Dependencies

- Next.js v14
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS (+ PostCSS)
- NextAuth.js v5 (beta)
- MongoDB
- Mongoose

## Todo

- [x] Build development environment
- [x] Build Dashboard
- [x] Build Users page
- [x] Build Products page
- [x] Authentication

## Notice

This project has not been built in your local development environment due to security issues with the database.

At this moment, I am going to build just two menus: Users and Products.

I did not originally plan this project; It was created by someone else. I have reproduced it in TypeScript and making extensive refactoring and reorganising the directory structure.
